            Alaric was born in a remote village near the High Forest. From an early age he displayed an unusual fascination with forgotten lore and arcane mysteries.

            His talent was recognized by a traveling sage of the Silverlight Enclave, who took him under their wing and introduced him to the ways of magic.

            Years later, his mentor vanished while searching for a lost divination artifact. Alaric set out to uncover the truth, believing that knowledge holds the key.
